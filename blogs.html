								Programming is the new trend today. But are you aware of some really mind blowing facts out it and its origin? Read it in the following points.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>  1.	Computer virus was not meant to be disastrous</b>
								<br>
								We all use an antivirus to protect our systems from getting hacked by a virus. But do you know the first ever virus 
								wasn’t harmful at all? There was a programmer named Fred Cohen who developed an anti-virus software without even an 
								existing virus. The virus designed by him had the ability to duplicate itself and move from one unit to the other. 
								Regrettably, the virus started growing rapidly.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>2. PHP was not a programming language</b>
								<br>
								PHP which is highly used for web development was not made to be a programming language initially. Rasmus Lerdorf, the creator of PHP, just created it for his own website but the language evolved eventually.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b> 3. The origin of the computer bug</b> 
								<br>
								A software bug or simply a computer bug is a flaw in a computer program or system that makes the computer to give a 
								wrong output. This computer bug was named after a real dead bug. Grace Hopper, an American computer expert found a 
								dead moth in the relay contacts of her computer from which the name “bug” was decided.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b> 4. Total Programming Languages that exist</b>
								<br>
								There are over 700 different programming languages which are either currently in use or are historical including C, C++, Python, Java, C#, R, Ruby, PHP, etc
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>5. Gaming Industry </b> 
								<br>
								The gaming commerce is approximately worth 30 billion dollars more than the movie industry.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>6. Origin of C</b>
								<br>
								C programming language developed by Dennis M. Ritchie was named so because it had a predecessor language called B. 
								B is type-less language, i.e., it has one data type: the computer word. It was developed from BCPL 
								("Basic Combined Programming Language").

								History of Semicolon in programming

								Semicolon is the symbol used in most of the programming languages.
								Its two main utilities are in the form of “statement separators” and
								“statement terminators”. Semicolon as a statement separator, allows
								the user to write more than one statement in a single line. Compiler
								uses it to estimate the end of one statement and the initiation of the
								other. In such a language, semicolon is considered optional and is
								usually not written in case of a one liner code.
								<br>
								<br>
								In early languages like Fortran, which was a computer-programming
								language in the mid 1950’s, semicolons were neither used as
								statement separators nor statement terminators.
								<br>
								<br>
								For the first time, the modern programming language which used a
								semicolon was ALGOL 58, soon replaced by ALGOL 60. The early
								version of ALGOL used it as a separator. Though it was often used
								superfluously as a statement terminator, the version that had the
								most impact on today’s languages was Basic Combined Programming
								Language (BCPL). BCPL language was developed at University of
								Cambridge in 1967 which later influenced the development of C
								language and even used semicolon as a statement separator.
								<br>
								<br>
								Another language that influenced the current use of semicolons was
								IBM’s programming language PL/I. It was developed in the mid-1960s
								and was just like the C++ language of its time. PL/I used semicolons as
								statement terminators.
								<br>
								<br>
								Around 1968, Ken Thompson began developing a new language
								based on BCPL, which he named as “B”. Thompson made several
								changes to his design of BCPL, among which the major one was to
								make semicolons mandatory as statement terminators. Thompson’s
								new language wasn’t entirely right as a systems programming
								language, thus from the scraps of B, C language was introduced.
