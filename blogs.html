								Semicolon is the symbol used in most of the programming languages.
								Its two main utilities are in the form of “statement separators” and
								“statement terminators”. Semicolon as a statement separator, allows
								the user to write more than one statement in a single line. Compiler
								uses it to estimate the end of one statement and the initiation of the
								other. In such a language, semicolon is considered optional and is
								usually not written in case of a one liner code.
								<br>
								<br>
								In early languages like Fortran, which was a computer-programming
								language in the mid 1950’s, semicolons were neither used as
								statement separators nor statement terminators.
								<br>
								<br>
								For the first time, the modern programming language which used a
								semicolon was ALGOL 58, soon replaced by ALGOL 60. The early
								version of ALGOL used it as a separator. Though it was often used
								superfluously as a statement terminator, the version that had the
								most impact on today’s languages was Basic Combined Programming
								Language (BCPL). BCPL language was developed at University of
								Cambridge in 1967 which later influenced the development of C
								language and even used semicolon as a statement separator.
								<br>
								<br>
								Another language that influenced the current use of semicolons was
								IBM’s programming language PL/I. It was developed in the mid-1960s
								and was just like the C++ language of its time. PL/I used semicolons as
								statement terminators.
								<br>
								<br>
								Around 1968, Ken Thompson began developing a new language
								based on BCPL, which he named as “B”. Thompson made several
								changes to his design of BCPL, among which the major one was to
								make semicolons mandatory as statement terminators. Thompson’s
								new language wasn’t entirely right as a systems programming
								language, thus from the scraps of B, C language was introduced.
